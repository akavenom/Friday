# Friday
Powered by Social media Health Analysis & Display Engine and IBM Watson, Friday understands your current state of mind,  
your overall taste in music and your interests and views about songs, artists or genres and gives you a specially curated,  
personalized playlist of the best songs she can find. Friday monitors and processes your activities on social media websites  
like Twitter and your interaction with the app itself to estimate what you would like the best.
